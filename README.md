# DC-Motor-Car
For a grade 12 physics project I was tasked with leading a group in building a DC motor to power an electric car. Due to previous shop and electrical work experience I led the build for the project including turning laminations for the core of the rotor which was a three armature design. The motor ended up having a large RPM output so I used a friction clutch and gearbox to establish a fictional car powered by the DC motor which won the competition.

- Friction clutch is seen in the top of the image above, the clutch made use of a piece of sheet metal acting like a leaf spring. In the bottom of the frame you can see the adjustable permanent magnets that made up the stator.

- From the side view you can see the full car with the wheels which were cut out from a sheet of plastic. Originally we wanted to use CD discs as they were made to a diameter with a tight tolerance. We decided against this as we would have to add a grip layer to the tiers as the discs weren't grippy enough. This would negate the usefulness of the CD's.

- The back view shows the commutator used for the motor which was made from a copper pipe which was then soldered to the coils. Using three armatures allowed for a self starting motor in any position.

- The top view shows the layout and commutators again with better context to the rest of the vehicle.
